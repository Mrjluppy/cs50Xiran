Designing an Attractive and Functional Personal Website with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

In this project, we aim to design an engaging and practical personal website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This site will serve as an online portfolio to introduce you and showcase your projects.

HTML Structure (index.html):

Within the index.html file, we establish the core structure of the website using HTML tags. This structure encompasses the following sections:

<header>: This section includes the website title, profile picture, main image, and a dark mode toggle button.
<main>: This section contains the primary content of the website, divided into three parts: about, projects, and contact.
about: This part features your personal information, social media links, and a music player.
projects: This part presents your projects in a list format.
contact: This part provides a contact form for visitors to reach you.
<footer>: This section displays the website's copyright information.
CSS Styling (styles.css):

In the styles.css file, we define the website's appearance using CSS rules. These rules include:

Base Styles: We define fundamental styles for the body, header, sections, forms, and other website elements.
Dark Mode: By adding the dark-mode class to the body tag, styles for the dark mode are applied.
Responsive Design: Using relative units and media queries, we optimize the website for proper display on various devices.
Animation Effects: We incorporate simple animation effects using the transition property for certain website elements.
Styles relating to images and the music player.
Adding Dark Mode Functionality with JavaScript (script.js):

In the script.js file, we add the dark mode feature to the website using JavaScript. This code involves:

Retrieving Elements: Using document.getElementById, we retrieve the dark mode toggle button and the website's body element.
Adding Event Listener: Using addEventListener, we attach a click event to the dark mode toggle button.
Toggling Class: Upon clicking the button, the dark-mode class is added to or removed from the body tag.
Key Considerations:

To utilize this code, ensure that the index.html, styles.css, and script.js files are located within the same folder.
Insert direct links to your images within the <img> tags.
Place your music file alongside the website files and name it your-music.mp3.
Replace submit_form.php with the appropriate PHP file for form processing.
Feel free to modify the CSS values to customize the website's appearance.
To add more functionalities, consider utilizing JavaScript libraries and frameworks.
By following these instructions and utilizing the provided code, you can create an attractive and functional personal website to effectively introduce yourself to your audience.
